# Contributing to `mini-projects`
  Thank you for contributing to our repository! Follow these guidelines when adding a project:

1. **Directory Structure:**
   - Navigate to the respective category directory (e.g., `cpp`, `android`, etc.).
   - Create a new subdirectory for your project.
   - Place relevant project files inside this subdirectory.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Update the category README if adding a new category.
   - For projects needing documentation:
     - Include installation instructions if necessary.
     - Describe input, output, and usage.
     - If GUI-related (web, Android, Flutter, etc.):
       - Add a project title.
       - Provide a brief project description.
       - Include screenshots or demos in a table format (if applicable).
       - If additional installation steps are required, provide clear instructions.
       - Demos are optional but encouraged for better understanding.

3. **Naming Convention:**
   - Follow existing file and project naming conventions.

4. **Readme Links:**
   - If the project needs detailed documentation, provide a link in the category README.
   - For simple scripts or self-explanatory projects, link directly to the project directory.

5. **Update Category README:**
   - If adding a new category, update the main README with the category details and link.

### Don't add unnecessary projects like rock paper scissor, management system, etc. They are of no use.
