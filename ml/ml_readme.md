## Machine Learning Projects
#### 1. Handwritten Digit Recognizer
> This is a Python code that trains a neural network model to classify handwritten digits.
- The code uses the MNIST dataset, which is a standard dataset of handwritten digits.
- The code compiles the model using the Adam optimizer and the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.

#### 2. Word Prediction
> This is a Python code that trains a neural network model to generate text. The code uses a technique called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
- The code then creates input and output sequences. The input sequences are sequences of characters of length 60. The output sequences are the next character in the sequence.
