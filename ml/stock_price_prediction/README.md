# **Stock_Price_Prediction**
### **Discription**
  - Our project is a valuable and innovative Model that aims to provide a much-needed solution for share market analysis using machine learning. <br>
  - By using sophisticated algorithms and advanced data analysis techniques, our application can help users identify potential changes in the stock price.<br>

### **Prerequists**
* Python is needed
* Tensorflow is needed. 
* Install any neccessary Library needed for model creation.

### **Installation**
* Assumuming the dataset(yahoo_stock.csv) is included in the same folder as `stock-prediction.ipynb`.<br>
* You just need to run the file the required partition and data pre processing will be done by the file itself.<br>
After that a `prediction.csv` file will be created. Which has the predicted values
Now, just run the `stock-prediction.ipynb` file.

### Working
* This program runs in the terminal.
* This software has Linear Regression model in it.
* Current R-square score is 99%.
* Plese read the comments from `stock-prediction.ipynb` to get better understanding of the model.
* Its simple to use just Run the python file `stock-prediction.ipynb`.
